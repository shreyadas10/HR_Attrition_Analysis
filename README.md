HR Attrition Analysis â€” End-to-End Data Analytics Project

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data to uncover key trends and insights that can help an organization improve employee retention.
It includes three core stages:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€” Conducted in Python using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to understand data patterns and visualize attrition by various factors such as age, gender, education, and salary.

Power BI Dashboard â€” An interactive HR dashboard displaying key KPIs such as Total Employees, Attrition Rate, and Employees Left, along with breakdowns by Department, Gender, Age Group, and Education.

SQL Analysis â€” SQL queries were written to calculate attrition rates, employee counts, and department-level summaries directly within a relational database, ensuring data integrity and analytical accuracy.
